# Diabetic Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This GitHub repository contains the source code and materials for a Diabetic Prediction system using machine learning. The project includes a web-based application developed using Streamlit for user interaction, Python for machine learning model training, and Firebase for database storage. 

## Functionality

### 1. Home

- The home section provides an introduction to the project and its purpose.

### 2. Registration (Sign Up/In)

- Users can create an account by signing up, or existing users can log in using their credentials.

### 3. Prediction

- Users can input relevant health information, and the system will predict whether they are at risk of diabetes based on a trained machine learning model.

### 4. Post Uploading

- Users can upload and share posts related to their health or experiences with diabetes.

### 5. To-Do List

- Users can create and manage a to-do list to help them track and manage their health-related tasks.

### 6. User Post Dashboard

- Users can view and manage their posted content and interact with posts from other users.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Machine Learning**: Python with scikit-learn
- **Dataset**: [Pima Indian Diabetes dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
- **Database**: Firebase

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetic-prediction.git
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up Firebase for database storage. You will need to create a Firebase project and configure the necessary credentials.

4. Run the Streamlit application:

   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Visit the web application in your browser.

2. Register or log in with your credentials.

3. Use the prediction feature to assess your risk of diabetes.

4. Share posts, manage your to-do list, and interact with other users on the platform.

## Data Source

The dataset used for training the machine learning model is the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset, which can be found on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database).
